# MultiCloud_Hotel_DBMS


**Luxury Hotel Project:**

The primary objective of this project is to maintain and manage the guest database for a luxury hotel. The database will include records of all guests, with a focus on tracking active COVID-19 cases among them. This information will be used to monitor the health status of guests during their stay, ensuring that the hotel can provide timely assistance and enforce hygiene policies effectively. The system will be designed to update records as needed, enabling the hotel to maintain a safe and welcoming environment for all guests.
